<!-- describe core functionalities and underlying concepts in more detail -->

<p>In the Open Integration Hub there is a great number of active integration flows
to be executed periodically. Each integration can be configured with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a> expression defining flow’s execution
interval. Let’s consider the following Cron expression:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">*</span>/3 <span class="k">*</span> <span class="k">*</span> <span class="k">*</span> <span class="k">*</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The cron expression above executes an integration flow at every 3rd
minute starting from the flow’s start time.</p>

<p>With the following Cron expression a flow is executed every Sunday at 6:00 am:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0 6 <span class="k">*</span> <span class="k">*</span> 7
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Scheduler iterates over all active integration flows and evaluates
their Cron expressions. Is a flow due to be executed, Scheduler tells the
Resource Coordinator to deploy the integration flow for execution.</p>
